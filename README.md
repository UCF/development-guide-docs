# CM Developer Guide and Standards

This repository contains a series of guides and standards meant to assist developers in the development of Web sites and application at the University of Central Florida. Specifically, this guide is being initially created and compiled by the Web Communications team as a set of internal documents to be used for onboarding and general reference. We hope that over time this documentation will be combined with standards and guides for web content creation and administration to create a compendium of web related topics that can be accessed in a central location.
